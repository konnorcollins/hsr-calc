# Honkai Star Rail Damage Calculator

It seemed like a good idea.

Built with Vite, React, Tailwind.


## Build

You will need a local installation of nodejs.  I recommend grabbing the latest stable 19.x.

Then run the following command.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Self-Hosting
There will be a docker image available at some point.  You can figure out the rest.

## Contributing
Still working this out.  Create an issue if you need anything fixed or added.

If you want to tinker, ensure you've got a nodejs installation.
Clone the repository.

Modify what you want and use the following dev script:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Manual Calculator
It's terrible and written in python.  Use at your own peril.

You'll need a >=3.9 python installation to run it.  Change the variables under the "STAT CONFIG" section to your needs.  
The python calculator is very barebones. You will likely need to do more than number tweaking depending on how specific your parameters are.
